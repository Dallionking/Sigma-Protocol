# /step-1.5-offer-architecture — Grand Slam Offer Design with Document Sync

**Mission**  
Design irresistible offers using Alex Hormozi's $100M framework, then **automatically synchronize** pricing and monetization decisions across all project documentation.

**Why This Step Exists:**  
For monetized apps (especially AI apps with credit systems, usage tiers, subscriptions), the offer architecture directly impacts:
- **Database schema** — credit ledgers, usage tracking, subscription tiers
- **API design** — rate limiting, quota enforcement, metering endpoints
- **UI/UX** — upgrade prompts, usage dashboards, paywall flows
- **Business logic** — billing cycles, overage handling, grace periods

**This step ensures pricing decisions are made BEFORE architecture, and all docs stay consistent.**

---

## 🔍 When to Use This Step

### Automatically Suggested After Step 1 When:
- ✅ Project type is SaaS, AI tool, or subscription service
- ✅ MASTER_PRD mentions: pricing, tiers, credits, subscriptions, monetization
- ✅ stack-profile.json includes a `payments` field
- ✅ User indicated revenue generation in ideation

### Skip This Step If:
- ❌ Internal tool or hobby project
- ❌ Open-source with no monetization
- ❌ Enterprise contract (custom pricing handled separately)

---

## ⚡ Preflight (auto)

```typescript
// 1. Get date
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];

// 2. Read existing project context
const masterPrd = await readFile('docs/specs/MASTER_PRD.md');
const stackProfile = await readFile('docs/stack-profile.json');

// 3. Check for existing offer architecture
const existingOffer = await fileExists('docs/specs/OFFER_ARCHITECTURE.md');

// 4. Extract current pricing info from MASTER_PRD (if any)
const currentPricing = extractSection(masterPrd, 'Business Model & Monetization');

// 5. Identify cost centers from dependencies
const packageJson = await readFile('package.json');
const deps = JSON.parse(packageJson).dependencies || {};
const costCenters = {
  ai: deps['openai'] || deps['@anthropic-ai/sdk'] || deps['@google/generative-ai'],
  database: deps['@supabase/supabase-js'] || deps['drizzle-orm'],
  payments: deps['stripe'] || deps['@polar-sh/sdk'] || deps['@revenuecat/purchases'],
};

// 6. Display context summary
console.log(`
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 STEP 1.5: OFFER ARCHITECTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Date: ${today}
Existing Offer: ${existingOffer ? 'Yes (will update)' : 'No (will create)'}
Cost Centers: ${Object.keys(costCenters).filter(k => costCenters[k]).join(', ')}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
`);
```

## 🔄 Phase A: Context & Cost Analysis

### A1-A2: Load Project Context

Read and summarize:
- **MASTER_PRD.md** — Product vision, features, target users
- **stack-profile.json** — Tech stack, especially payment provider
- **package.json** — Dependencies for cost estimation

### A3: Calculate COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)

**For AI Apps - Critical Cost Factors:**

```markdown
## 💰 COGS Analysis

### Variable Costs Per User (Monthly)

| Cost Center | Calculation | Monthly Cost |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **AI Tokens** | [model] × [avg requests] × [tokens/request] | $X.XX |
| **Database** | [storage GB] × [rate] + [compute] | $X.XX |
| **File Storage** | [avg GB/user] × [rate] | $X.XX |
| **Email/Notifications** | [emails/month] × [rate] | $X.XX |
| **Third-party APIs** | [calls/month] × [rate] | $X.XX |
| **Support Allocation** | [avg tickets] × [cost/ticket] | $X.XX |
| **TOTAL COGS/USER** | | **$X.XX** |

### Pricing Floor Calculation

- COGS/user: $X.XX/month
- Minimum 3x margin: $X.XX/month
- Target 5x margin (SaaS standard): $X.XX/month
- Premium 10x margin (if value supports): $X.XX/month

### Credit/Usage Considerations (if applicable)

| Usage Tier | Credits/Month | AI Calls | Storage | Price Floor |
|------------|---------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Starter | X | Y | Z GB | $XX |
| Pro | X | Y | Z GB | $XX |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Y | Z GB | $XX |
```

**CHECKPOINT A:** Present cost analysis. Ask: "Does this COGS estimate look accurate? Any costs I'm missing?"

---

## 🔄 Phase B: Offer Design

**Invoke the core offer design process from @04-offer-architect:**

### B1: Target Avatar & Dream Outcome

Pull from MASTER_PRD's Target Audience section, then refine:

```markdown

**Avatar Score (Hormozi's 4 Indicators):**
| Indicator | Score (1-10) | Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Massive Pain | X | [Why it hurts] |
| Purchasing Power | X | [Budget evidence] |
| Easy to Target | X | [Where to find them] |
| Growing Market | X | [Growth data] |
