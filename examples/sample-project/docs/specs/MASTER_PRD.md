## Executive Summary

### Vision
Build a collaborative task management platform that helps small-to-medium teams organize, prioritize, and complete work efficiently through intuitive boards, real-time collaboration, and smart integrations.

### Value Equation Assessment (Hormozi Framework)

```
VALUE = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)
```

| Factor | Rating | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Dream Outcome** | 8/10 | Teams ship faster with less coordination overhead |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | 8/10 | Proven category with clear user demand |
| **Time Delay** | 7/10 | Usable MVP in 6 weeks, full product in 12 |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** | 7/10 | Low learning curve, 5-minute onboarding |
| **Calculated Value Score** | **8.0/10** | Strong value proposition |

### Problem Statement

**Primary Problem:**
Small teams struggle with task management because:
1. **Scattered communication** -- Tasks discussed in Slack, tracked in spreadsheets, documented in docs
2. **No visibility** -- Managers cannot see workload distribution or blockers at a glance
3. **Context switching** -- Jumping between tools to understand what needs to happen next
4. **Lost accountability** -- No clear owner, no due dates, no follow-through tracking
5. **Onboarding friction** -- New team members take days to understand what is in progress

**User Pain (Quantified):**
- Teams spend 3-5 hours/week in status meetings that a good board would eliminate
- 40% of tasks slip deadlines due to invisible dependencies
- New hires take 1-2 weeks to understand team workflow
- Managers check 4+ tools to build a status report

### Target Users

| Attribute | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| **Role** | Team leads, project managers, individual contributors |
| **Team Size** | 3-25 people |
| **Industry** | Software, marketing, operations |
| **Technical Skill** | Low to moderate |
| **Current Tools** | Spreadsheets, Slack threads, sticky notes |
| **Goal** | Ship work on time with clear accountability |

### Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Weekly Active Teams | 500 | 6 months |
| Task Completion Rate | >70% on time | Ongoing |
| Onboarding Time | <5 minutes to first task | Ongoing |
| NPS Score | >50 | 90 days |
| Daily Active Users | 60% of registered | 90 days |
