# Example: TaskFlow (Sample Project)

This directory contains sample outputs from running the full Sigma Protocol workflow on a fictional product called **TaskFlow** -- a team task management SaaS application.

Each file shows the structure and format you can expect from each step of the protocol. The content has been truncated for brevity; actual outputs are typically much longer and more detailed.

## What Is TaskFlow?

TaskFlow is a collaborative task management platform where teams can organize work into boards, assign tasks, track progress, and integrate with tools like Slack and GitHub. Think of it as a simplified project management tool.

## File Map

| File | Protocol Step | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `docs/specs/MASTER_PRD.md` | Step 1: Ideation | Product requirements document |
| `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Step 2: Architecture | System design and tech stack |
| `docs/ux/UX-DESIGN.md` | Step 3: UX Design | Personas, journeys, principles |
| `docs/flows/FLOW-TREE.md` | Step 4: Flow Tree | Screen inventory and navigation |
| `docs/design/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` | Step 6: Design System | Tokens, colors, typography |
| `docs/states/STATE-SPEC.md` | Step 7: Interface States | Loading, empty, error states |
| `docs/technical/TECHNICAL-SPEC.md` | Step 8: Technical Spec | Database, APIs, project structure |
| `docs/implementation/FEATURE-BREAKDOWN.md` | Step 10: Feature Breakdown | Epics, stories, estimates |
| `docs/prds/F01-task-boards.md` | Step 11: PRD Generation | Individual feature PRD |
| `docs/prds/F02-team-collaboration.md` | Step 11: PRD Generation | Second feature PRD |
| `stack-profile.json` | Config | Tech stack choices |

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Understand the format** -- Each file mirrors the structure that the corresponding protocol step produces.
2. **Adapt to your product** -- Replace TaskFlow concepts with your own domain.
3. **Expect more detail** -- Real outputs are 2-5x longer than these truncated samples.
